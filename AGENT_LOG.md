## How I Used AI Tools
I used AI to assist me in various aspects. 

Typical usage included:
- Generating UI
- Discussing RLS cases for DB
- Debugging issues due to RLS
- Debugging issues due to client side components being used in server side

## Example Prompts
- Why does Supabase `.single()` fail with nested relations?
- Refactor code without changing behavior

## Refinements & Learnings
- Better understanding of Supabase 
- Clear separation of server and client responsibilities
- Improved handling of browser-only dependencies

## AI Usage Philosophy
AI was used to speed up iteration and catch edge cases.
Final decisions, trade-offs, and structure were made by me.
